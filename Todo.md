Todo tasks
----------

- how do we use approx:: for unit tests?
- array2d supports approx over whole arrays more easily
- array2d version of EPG
  - do we want 3xN or Nx3? benchmark.
  - transpose and shift or just shift?


- try making a more efficient version of the deque using
rotate_right etc
- benchmark both implementations
- think about how we parallelize
- implement other EPG physics like MT and Diffusion.

maybe not:
(better to provide python wrapper?)
- implement plotting of signal 
- plotting of fzk states.


- sequences, on trait 
  - fid
  - se
  - fse
